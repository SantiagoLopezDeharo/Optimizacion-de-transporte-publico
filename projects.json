    "fullDescription": "<p><strong>Distribuidora Luna</strong> is a pharmacy products distributor based in Uruguay that managed a large network of pharmacies as clients. As the business grew, the company began facing challenges in keeping up with purchase orders and coordinating logistics efficiently. </p><p>To address these issues, I designed and developed a <strong>web-based e-commerce platform</strong> that enabled the company to centrally manage products, clients, and purchase orders. The platform allowed pharmacies to access a dedicated web portal through managed user accounts and place orders directly online. All new orders were instantly reflected and notified in an administrative dashboard, significantly improving response times and order tracking. </p><p> In addition, since the company relied on an on-street salesperson who regularly visited pharmacies to take orders, I developed a <strong>mobile application</strong> tailored to this workflow. The app allowed the salesperson to create purchase orders on behalf of the pharmacies they attended and receive <strong>push notifications</strong> whenever a new order was placed through the system.</p><p>This real-time synchronization helped prevent duplicate visits to pharmacies that had already placed an order on the same day, optimizing both sales operations and logistics planning.</p><h3>Key Features</h3><ul><li>  <strong>Pharmacy portal:</strong> product browsing (categories/search/sorting), cart, order creation, and order  history.</li><li>  <strong>Admin dashboard:</strong> KPIs and analytics (revenue, orders, active pharmacies, top products, sales trend,  sales by category/pharmacy).</li><li>  <strong>Order management:</strong> pending/completed views, search + pagination, status updates (e.g., delivered).</li><li>  <strong>Invoices:</strong> admins can upload a <strong>PDF invoice</strong> when completing an order; authorized  users can list and download invoices.</li><li>  <strong>User & access management:</strong> administrators with role-based permissions (e.g., stats, orders, products,  promotions, users), plus vendor, client, and pharmacy management (including pharmacy enable/disable and associations).</li><li>  <strong>Promotions:</strong> “buy N get M” promotions tied to products, with activation toggles.</li><li>  <strong>Salesperson mobile app:</strong> authentication, fast product search, cart-based order creation on behalf of  a selected pharmacy, and viewing active orders.</li></ul>",

This app was built to help users identify underpayments, missed    overtime, and potential wage violations, and even connect them with legal support when    necessary.</p>  <h2>Core Value Proposition</h2>  <p>    WageWatch empowers workers — especially those with hourly jobs in industries like    construction, retail, hospitality, delivery, and healthcare — to “police their    paychecks” by comparing their logged hours and agreed-upon wage rates against what    they actually received. The app flags discrepancies that might indicate wage theft    or underpayment, helping users better understand their pay. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}  </p>  <h2>Key Features</h2>  <ul class='feature-list'>    <li><strong>Work Time Tracking:</strong> Log hours worked with weekly or monthly schedules. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}</li>    <li><strong>Pay Verification:</strong> Upload paycheck photos and compare actual pay against logged hours and rates. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}</li>    <li><strong>Discrepancy Alerts:</strong> Get alerts when potential wage violations are detected. :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}</li>    <li><strong>Tips & Bonuses Logging:</strong> Record additional earnings like tips to see full compensation. :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}</li>    <li><strong>Custom Break Settings:</strong> Include unpaid breaks and override automatic deductions. :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}</li>    <li><strong>Legal Support Links:</strong> Connect with legal help or union resources when discrepancies are found. :contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}</li>    <li><strong>Coworker Collaboration:</strong> Explore group or class-action options with coworkers. :contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8}</li>  </ul>  <div class='note'>    <strong>Note:</strong> To support accurate compliance checking across different U.S. states and    their unique labor laws and wage requirements, we developed a powerful <strong>Rule Engine</strong>.

It enters a 'Pending for Approval' (PFA) state, moving through a sequential chain of internal approvers. Once cleared, the PO is published to the <strong>Supplier Portal</strong>.         </p>        <p>            Suppliers then interact with the PO in real-time. If changes are requested, the <strong>Buyer Portal</strong> allows internal teams to review, comment on, and ultimately approve modifications. Once a final agreement is reached, the system automatically synchronizes the updated data back to the SAP ERP via OData services, ensuring the 'Single Source of Truth' is maintained without manual entry.        </p>    </section></article>",

    "fullDescription": "<p><strong>Paradas AE</strong> is an academic project centered on optimizing public transport stop locations and service planning through data analysis and multi-objective evaluation.</p><p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> well-placed stops reduce average walking distance, improve network coverage, increase accessibility for vulnerable users, and help balance operational costs with user experience. Optimizing stop placement directly impacts ridership, equity, and overall efficiency of the transit system.</p><p><strong>Methodology:</strong> the problem is modeled as a multi-objective optimization task with three explicit objectives: (1) maximize passenger coverage, (2) minimize the number of active stops, and (3) minimize a demand-weighted cost that penalizes low-demand locations. Solutions are encoded as integer vectors (0–3 per segment) and evaluated using normalized objective components to make tradeoffs comparable. A Pareto-based evolutionary search (NSGA-II style) is used to obtain a set of non-dominated alternatives rather than a single point solution.</p><p><strong>Results quality:</strong> the implementation exports multi-objective Pareto fronts with normalized metrics, enabling clear compromise solutions for decision-makers. The resulting fronts are stable across runs and show consistent improvements in coverage versus cost/stop count tradeoffs.</p><p>Repository: <a href='https://github.com/SantiagoLopezDeharo/Optimizacion-de-transporte-publico' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>GitHub repo</a>.</p><p>This work was part of the Ibero-American Congress of Puebla, Mexico on Smart Cities (ICSC CITIES 2025).</p><p>Certificate of participation: <a href='https://drive.google.com/file/d/1PUIVQ3CvUUiOFQt_DtjZm_eeu_XJ-alD/view?usp=drive_link' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>View certificate</a>.</p>",
